# 🧬 Neutrophil RNA-Seq Pipeline: GM-CSF & TNF-α Response

This project analyzes transcriptomic responses of **human neutrophils** stimulated with **GM-CSF**, **TNF-α**, or left untreated, using a **Nextflow-based RNA-seq pipeline**.

---

## 🔬 Biological Context

- **GM-CSF** reprograms neutrophils into a transcriptionally distinct, pro-migratory, neuro-immune-activated state
- Enriched GO terms include: `axonogenesis`, `neuron projection development`, `dendritic morphogenesis`
- **TNF-α** shows a milder transcriptional effect
